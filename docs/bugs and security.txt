* download zip file causes a submitFail timeout alert - need to stop it before it starts

* I'm still concerned about the security of renaming where I could use folder rename exclusions to hack in a name change to a malicious file extension
* if the session mirror gets out of synch it should be caught (note 0400918), but out-of-synch only based on a case difference would go uncaught
* in session mirror, [index] is indexed lowercase, but the [folders] node is actual binary of folder names - THIS MAY CAUSE FAILURES IN SOME PLACES

uuploading file right now has no constraints or protection
someone could hack the objectNameForm and put a file on someone else's site (but not a malicious one)

the boxedfolder tag in .file_explorer.stats.dbr file is not being written properly
ON RENAME OF A FOLDER, we would lose the boxing 'cause the boxedfolder tag is not changed
timeouts are still a huge problem

download zip file doesn't go into subfolders (and need option whether to or not)
after I hid .thumbs.dbr. the folder stats are still showing "1 folder"
