DONE	1. got a proliferation going on with the html for the file objects - need a function to generate this - and a consistency between the entire list and a single list.
DONE	1b. when I upload a new image, it needs to recalc the thumbnail
FIXED	Bugs (see 1b. above - no js refresh showing, code not right)
DONE	2. need to know how many, total file size for folder, and see the path plainly
DONE	3. context menu in place sensibly
DONE	4. first option must be to delete
DONE	8. put "help" on the context menu
5. implement the "back" and forward concept in session for the uid
6. handle ghosting on system folders and allow for folders to be hidden
	6b. NOTE!!!! I have hidden .thumbs.dbr but this is not yet fully thought out in terms of system folders, permissions, etc. etc.
7. handle locking of folders, stored and read from .thumbs.dbr
8. be able to surf to another folder while uploading a file

9. refine the sending email emergency file

TESTING: see if I can upload an image, view it, and then delete it, also making sure maxNode keeps up with several adds and deletes.
